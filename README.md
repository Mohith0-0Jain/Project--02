# Project--02
A Airbnb-inspired app where users can sign up, log in, and upload property listings. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, it uses MongoDB Atlas for cloud database storage, Cloudinary for media management, and Passport.js for authentication. The UI is designed with Bootstrap, and the project is hosted on Render for easy access.
